Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try, as I cannot directly resolve these external issues:


   1. Check File Permissions:
       * Navigate to C:\Users\A R Khan\OneDrive\Documents\Trae\software\dist\ in File Explorer.
       * Right-click on the main.exe file and select "Properties".
       * Go to the "Security" tab and ensure your user account has "Full control" or at least "Read & execute" permissions. If not, try to grant
         them.


   2. Close All Applications:
       * Ensure no other programs (like text editors, command prompts, or even File Explorer windows) are currently accessing or locking main.exe
         or any files in the dist folder. Close them and try compiling again.


   3. Temporarily Disable Antivirus/Security Software:
       * Sometimes, antivirus or other security software can interfere with executable files. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus and then
         attempt to compile the Inno Setup script. Remember to re-enable it afterward.


   4. Re-run PyInstaller:
       * It's possible main.exe itself is corrupted or not properly generated. Try running pyinstaller --onefile main.py again to create a fresh
         main.exe.

   5. Reinstall Inno Setup:
       * As a last resort, if none of the above work, consider uninstalling and then reinstalling Inno Setup.


  Please try these steps. If the error persists, check if Inno Setup provides any more detailed error messages or logs that could give us more
  specific clues.
